Hello! üëãüèæ

I'm Ire, a User Interface Designer and Front-End Developer based in Lagos, Nigeria. 

A few weeks ago, the Final Release of Angular 2.0 was finally released!

Angular 2 has had a pretty bad rap for being so drastically different to Angular 1, it's essentially like learning a whole new framework. 

In my time trying to get to grips with Angular 2, my main frustration has been the lack of accurate resources I can rely on. This has partly been due to the fact that it has been in beta so many (breaking) changes have occurred over a short period of time. But also, it's basically a brand new framework, so everyone is still learning it too. 

Thus, Hello Angular is born.

Myself (and hopefully some [contributors](/contributing)) will provide content on developing applications with Angular 2. We will cover everything from TypeScript, IDEs, the Angular CLI, and, of course, the framework itself.
